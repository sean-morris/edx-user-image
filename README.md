# edx-user-image

See this repository's [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/berkeley-dsep-infra/edx-user-image/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for instructions. That information will eventually be migrated to docs.datahub.berkeley.edu.

# Building the image locally

You should use [repo2-docker](https://repo2docker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to build and use/test the image on your own device before you push and create a PR.  It's better (and typically faster) to do this first before using CI/CD.  There's no need to waste Github Action minutes to test build images when you can do this on your own device!

Run `repo2docker` from inside the cloned image repo.  To run on a linux/WSL2 linux shell:
```
repo2docker . # <--- the path to the repo
```

If you are using an ARM CPU (Apple M* silicon), you will need to run `jupyter-repo2docker` with the following arguments:

```
jupyter-repo2docker --user-id=1000 --user-name=jovyan \
  --Repo2Docker.platform=linux/amd64 \
  --target-repo-dir=/home/jovyan/.cache \
  -e PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=/srv/conda \
  . # <--- the path to the repo
```

If you just want to see if the image builds, but not automatically launch the server, add `--no-run` to the arguments (before the final `.`).

## Continuous Integration (CI)

### Workflows

| Workflow | Trigger | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `yaml-lint.yaml` | `pull_request` | Lints all YAML files via the shared workflow in `berkeley-dsep-infra/update-deployment` |
| `build-test-image.yaml` | `pull_request` | Builds and tests the image via the shared workflow in `berkeley-dsep-infra/update-deployment` |
| `grader-check.yml` | `pull_request_target` | Builds the PR image locally, fetches notebooks from the autograder repos, and runs `grader.check` tests |
| `build-push-create-pr.yaml` | Push of a version tag (`X.Y.Z`) or manual `workflow_dispatch` | Builds and pushes the image to Google Artifact Registry, tags it with the version number, and opens a PR in [edx-hub](https://github.com/edx-berkeley/edx-hub) to update the deployment image tag |

The `build-test-image.yaml` and `yaml-lint.yaml` workflows ignore changes to `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `LICENSE`, `.github/**`, and `images/**`. The `grader-check.yml` workflow ignores the same paths.

### Releases

Push a version tag in the format `X.Y.Z` to trigger a production release build:

```bash
git tag X.Y.Z
git push upstream X.Y.Z. <-- assuming your origin is your fork
```

CI will build the image, push it to Google Artifact Registry, and automatically open a PR in `edx-hub` to update the deployed image tag.

### Slack notifications

CI results are posted to the **#edx-hub-ci** channel in the **UCB DS External** Slack workspace. To request access, contact a team member or reach out to sean.smorris@berkeley.edu.

The following workflows post to Slack on every run (success or failure):
- `grader-check.yml` — on every PR
- `build-push-create-pr.yaml` — on every release tag build

### Repository variables and secrets

The following must be configured on the repository (or the `edx-berkeley` organization) for CI to function:

**Variables (`vars.*`):**

| Name | Description |
|---|---|
| `IMAGE` | Full image path in Google Artifact Registry (e.g., `data8x-scratch/user-images/edx-user-image`) |
| `HUB` | Deployment name used to find and update the image tag in edx-hub |
| `EDX_IMAGE_BUILDER_APP_ID` | GitHub App ID used to open PRs in edx-hub |
| `IMAGE_BUILDER_BOT_EMAIL` | Git author email for automated commits to edx-hub |
| `IMAGE_BUILDER_BOT_NAME` | Git author name for automated commits to edx-hub |
| `OTTER_AUTOGRADERS_APP_ID` | GitHub App ID for reading autograder repos |
| `OTTER_AUTOGRADERS_INSTALLATION_ID` | Installation ID for the autograder GitHub App |

**Secrets (`secrets.*`):**

| Name | Description |
|---|---|
| `GAR_SECRET_KEY_EDX` | GCP service account JSON key with push access to Google Artifact Registry |
| `EDX_IMAGE_BUILDER_PRIVATE_KEY` | Private key for the GitHub App that opens PRs in edx-hub |
| `OTTER_AUTOGRADERS_PRIVATE_KEY` | Private key for the GitHub App that reads autograder repos (shared with otter-service and xDevs) |
| `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` | Incoming webhook URL for the `#edx-hub-ci` Slack channel |
